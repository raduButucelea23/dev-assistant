  "contentSummary": "Risk assessment for the Navigation System identifying three key risks: Route Manipulation Risk (RISK-NAV-01), GPS Spoofing Risk (RISK-NAV-02), and Location Privacy Risk (RISK-NAV-03). Two risks are rated as High (Route Manipulation and Location Privacy) and one as Medium (GPS Spoofing). The document proposes six security controls designed to mitigate these risks, including cryptographic map verification, multi-source position verification, enhanced location data protection, secure map update channels, GPS signal anomaly detection, and location data access controls. Implementation of these controls is expected to reduce all identified risks to a Low residual risk level. The risk treatment strategy focuses on risk reduction through security controls, with conditional acceptance pending implementation and verification of all controls."

  "contentSummary": "This TARA Risk Assessment document evaluates the cybersecurity risks associated with the Camera System Integration function based on previously identified threat scenarios. The assessment identifies five key risks: (1) Camera Feed Manipulation - rated high risk due to potential for incorrect driving decisions; (2) Camera System Denial of Service - rated medium risk due to potential loss of critical visual information; (3) Calibration Parameter Tampering - rated medium risk due to potential distortion of visual information; (4) Driver Monitoring Data Exfiltration - rated medium risk due to privacy implications; and (5) False ADAS Activation - rated high risk due to critical safety implications of unwarranted emergency maneuvers. For each risk, the document defines comprehensive treatment strategies with specific security controls spanning prevention, detection, and recovery measures. Key controls include cryptographic authentication of camera data, multi-sensor validation for critical information, resource isolation for critical functions, data encryption and minimization for privacy protection, and defense-in-depth measures for ADAS activation security. Each control is linked to verification tests and expected risk reduction, with residual risk assessments indicating that all risks can be reduced to acceptable levels through implementation of the specified controls."

  "contentSummary": "This TARA Impact Analysis document evaluates the potential impacts of cybersecurity attacks on the Head Unit Display function. Three key damage scenarios are identified: Display Tampering (high impact), which could affect safety through manipulation of critical warnings; Touch Input Manipulation (medium impact), which could affect vehicle operation through injection or manipulation of user inputs; and Sensitive Information Exposure (high impact), which primarily threatens user privacy and regulatory compliance. The Head Unit Display is assessed as a high-value asset with significant external exposure through multiple connectivity interfaces. Four cybersecurity goals are established to address the identified damage scenarios: Display Integrity (to prevent tampering with displayed information), Input Control Integrity (to ensure touch inputs are processed accurately), Display Privacy (to protect sensitive displayed information), and Display Availability (to maintain essential functionality). The document establishes traceability to system requirements, related documents, and applicable standards, providing a comprehensive assessment of security impacts for the Head Unit Display function."

  "contentSummary": "This TARA Threat Scenarios document identifies and analyzes three primary threats to the Voice Recognition System: Voice Command Spoofing (TS-VR-01), where an attacker uses synthetic speech or replayed recordings to issue unauthorized commands; Voice Authentication Bypass (TS-VR-02), where an attacker circumvents voice-based authentication to gain unauthorized access to restricted functions; and Voice Data Exfiltration (TS-VR-03), where voice recordings and biometric data are accessed without authorization. Each threat scenario includes a detailed attack vector analysis, step-by-step attack progression, STPA analysis of control flaws, and attack feasibility assessment using the CVSS Base method. Multiple vulnerabilities are identified for each scenario, including insufficient multi-factor authentication, weak liveness detection, inadequate encryption, and excessive data retention. The document also evaluates existing controls, noting their limitations in addressing these threats. This analysis provides the foundation for subsequent risk assessment and security requirements development for the Voice Recognition System."

  "contentSummary": "This TARA Threat Scenarios document identifies and analyzes five key threat scenarios affecting the Camera System Integration function: (1) Camera Feed Manipulation - falsification of visual data leading to incorrect driving decisions; (2) Camera System Denial of Service - disruption of camera availability during critical operations like reversing; (3) Calibration Parameter Tampering - modification of camera calibration causing distorted visual information; (4) Driver Monitoring Data Exfiltration - unauthorized access to sensitive driver monitoring data; and (5) False Object Injection for ADAS Activation - causing unwarranted emergency interventions through falsified visual hazards. Each threat scenario is analyzed in depth, including attack vectors, attack steps, and STPA-based analysis of control flaws, unsafe control actions, and resulting loss scenarios. The feasibility assessment rates the scenarios using CVSS, with False Object Injection rated highest severity due to its potential to cause accidents through unexpected vehicle interventions. The document identifies specific vulnerabilities and existing controls for each threat scenario, providing a comprehensive foundation for subsequent risk assessment and security control definition."

  "contentSummary": "This TARA Impact Analysis document evaluates potential damage scenarios related to the Vehicle Status Display function within the Instrument Cluster system. The analysis identifies four key damage scenarios: (1) Status Information Falsification - manipulation of critical vehicle information displayed to the driver, rated as high impact with ASIL C classification; (2) Critical Warning Suppression - prevention of essential warnings from being displayed, also rated as high impact with ASIL C classification; (3) False Warning Flooding - generation of numerous false warnings causing driver distraction and warning fatigue, rated as medium impact with ASIL B classification; and (4) Display Black-Out or Freeze - complete failure of the display preventing driver access to critical information, rated as high impact with ASIL C classification. The Vehicle Status Display is assessed as a high-value asset due to its critical role in vehicle safety. Four cybersecurity goals are established to address the identified damage scenarios, focusing on information integrity, warning message availability, display functionality protection, and warning message authenticity. The document establishes clear relationships to relevant standards, related documents, and system requirements to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential security risks to this safety-critical vehicle function."

  "contentSummary": "This document identifies and analyzes three key threat scenarios targeting the vehicle's Bluetooth Connectivity system: Bluetooth Pairing Exploitation (leveraging vulnerabilities in the pairing process), Bluetooth Communication Eavesdropping (intercepting and decrypting communications), and Bluetooth Denial of Service Attack (disrupting connectivity through various methods). Each scenario is analyzed in depth, including multiple attack vectors, detailed attack steps, STPA control flaw analysis, threat assessment using CVSS methodology, identified vulnerabilities with CWE references, and evaluation of existing controls. The findings indicate medium to high feasibility for these attacks, with significant impacts on privacy and system availability. The document establishes the foundation for subsequent risk assessment and countermeasure development."

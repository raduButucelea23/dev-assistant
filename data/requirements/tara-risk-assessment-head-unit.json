  "contentSummary": "This TARA Risk Assessment document analyzes the security risks associated with the Head Unit Display function and defines security requirements to address these risks. Three primary risks are assessed: Display Content Tampering Risk (RISK-HU-01), which is rated as high risk due to potential safety implications; Touch Input Command Injection Risk (RISK-HU-02), which is rated as medium risk affecting vehicle control; and Screen Scraping Attack Risk (RISK-HU-03), which is rated as critical risk due to privacy and data protection concerns. For each risk, the document provides recommended controls with implementation priorities, such as display content verification, input validation, and memory protection mechanisms. The document defines eight specific security requirements targeting these risks, all planned for implementation and verification through various testing methods. These requirements range from display content integrity verification to sensitive data protection and debug interface security. The document establishes traceability to impact analysis and threat scenarios, ensuring a complete risk management approach for the Head Unit Display function."

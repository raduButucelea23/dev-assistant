  "contentSummary": "This TARA Threat Scenarios document identifies and analyzes potential attack scenarios targeting the Head Unit Display function. Three primary threat scenarios are detailed: Display Content Tampering (TS-HU-01), which involves manipulation of displayed information to mislead users; Touch Input Command Injection (TS-HU-02), which involves injecting false touch inputs to trigger unintended actions; and Screen Scraping Attack (TS-HU-03), which targets sensitive information displayed on screen. Each threat scenario includes attack vectors, attack steps, STPA analysis of unsafe control actions and control flaws, and attack feasibility ratings using the CVSS Base method. The document identifies nine specific vulnerabilities across the three threat scenarios, ranging from insufficient input validation to unprotected display buffer memory. Existing controls are evaluated for each threat, though most are found to have only low to medium effectiveness. The document provides traceability to damage scenarios from the Impact Analysis phase and establishes relationships to subsequent Risk Assessment activities, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the TARA process for the Head Unit Display function."

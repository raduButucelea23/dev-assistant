  "contentSummary": "This TARA Impact Analysis document evaluates potential cybersecurity incidents affecting the Camera System Integration function, which processes data from multiple vehicle cameras to support driver awareness and ADAS functions. The analysis identifies five key damage scenarios: (1) Visual Misinformation - falsified camera feeds causing incorrect driving decisions; (2) Camera System Unavailability - loss of critical visual information during maneuvers; (3) Calibration Parameter Corruption - distorted visual information affecting spatial perception; (4) Driver Privacy Exposure - unauthorized access to in-cabin monitoring data; and (5) False ADAS Activation - injected visual hazards triggering unwarranted emergency responses. Each scenario is assessed across six impact dimensions (safety, financial, operational, privacy, regulatory, and reputational) with corresponding ASIL classifications and FMEA risk ratings. The Camera System Integration is rated as a high-value asset due to its safety-critical functions and data sensitivity. Based on the damage scenarios, five cybersecurity goals are established to protect system integrity, availability, calibration accuracy, privacy, and ADAS security. The document provides a structured foundation for subsequent threat scenario analysis and risk assessment phases, helping prioritize security measures based on potential impact severity."

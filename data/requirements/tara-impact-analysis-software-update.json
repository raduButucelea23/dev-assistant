  "contentSummary": "This TARA Impact Analysis document evaluates the potential damage scenarios related to the Software Update System (SUS), which is responsible for securely managing over-the-air (OTA) updates to vehicle ECUs. The analysis identifies four key damage scenarios: (1) Malicious Software Installation - rated as severe impact due to potential control of safety-critical systems; (2) Software Update Prevention - rated as high impact due to persistence of known vulnerabilities; (3) Unauthorized Software Rollback - rated as high impact due to reintroduction of patched vulnerabilities; and (4) Update System Compromise - rated as severe impact due to potential fleetwide implications. Each scenario is evaluated across multiple impact dimensions including safety, financial, operational, privacy, regulatory, and reputational aspects, with corresponding ASIL and FMEA ratings. The document assesses the Software Update System as a critical asset due to its privileged role in modifying ECU software, its exposure to external networks, and its attractiveness as an attack target. Four cybersecurity goals are defined to address the identified damage scenarios: Update Authenticity, Update Availability, Update Version Control, and Update Infrastructure Security. The analysis establishes traceability to related documents, standards (including ISO21434 and UNECE R156), and system requirements to ensure comprehensive coverage of the security risks associated with the Software Update System."

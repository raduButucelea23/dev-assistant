Each scenario details the attack vector, steps, control flaws per STPA methodology, and attack feasibility assessment using CVSS. Attack feasibility ratings range from MEDIUM for spoofing and replay attacks to HIGH for denial of service attacks. All scenarios show insufficient existing controls, requiring additional security measures as identified in the complementary risk assessment document."

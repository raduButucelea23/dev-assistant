For each scenario, impacts are assessed across safety, financial, operational, privacy, and reputational dimensions. Overall impact ratings are HIGH for unauthorized door unlock and MEDIUM for replay attacks and denial of service. These impact ratings inform subsequent risk assessment and cybersecurity control requirements."

Each scenario details attack vectors, attack steps, and STPA analysis examining control flaws that enable attacks. Threat assessment using CVSS Base methodology rates the attack feasibility of each threat as Medium. The document identifies relevant vulnerabilities and existing controls, noting their limited effectiveness against the sophisticated threats described. This analysis identifies the need for additional security controls as specified in the risk assessment document."

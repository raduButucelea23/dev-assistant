  "contentSummary": "This TARA Risk Assessment document analyzes and evaluates the cybersecurity risks associated with the Vehicle Status Display function in the Instrument Cluster system. The assessment identifies four primary risks: (1) Status Information Falsification Risk - rated as high risk due to potential safety implications of displaying incorrect vehicle information; (2) Warning Indicator Suppression Risk - rated as medium risk, involving suppression of critical warnings through ECU compromise; (3) False Warning Flooding Risk - rated as medium risk, involving injection of false warnings causing driver confusion; and (4) Display System Denial of Service Risk - rated as high risk, involving preventing the display system from functioning properly. For each risk, specific security controls are recommended, including message authentication, multi-source validation, warning system redundancy, secure boot mechanisms, warning message prioritization, and enhanced resource management. Eight specific security requirements are defined to address these risks, all planned for implementation and verification through various testing methods. The document establishes relationships with previous TARA phases (Impact Analysis and Threat Scenarios) and maps the security requirements to system-level requirements for the Instrument Cluster. This assessment provides a comprehensive foundation for implementing appropriate security controls to protect the Vehicle Status Display function from potential cybersecurity attacks."

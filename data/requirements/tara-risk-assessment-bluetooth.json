  "contentSummary": "This document provides a comprehensive risk assessment for the Bluetooth Connectivity system based on previously identified threat and damage scenarios. Three primary risks are evaluated: Unauthorized Device Pairing (High risk), Bluetooth Communication Eavesdropping (Medium risk), and Bluetooth Denial of Service (Medium risk). Each risk is analyzed according to ISO21434 methodology, combining attack feasibility and impact severity across multiple dimensions including safety, financial, operational, privacy, regulatory and reputational impacts. The assessment reveals that privacy and regulatory impacts are most significant for unauthorized access and eavesdropping risks, while operational impacts dominate for denial of service risks. The document details risk treatment strategies with proposed controls for each risk, including enhanced pairing security, additional encryption layers, and improved resilience measures. Implementation of these controls is expected to reduce all identified risks to a low residual level."

  "contentSummary": "This TARA Risk Assessment document analyzes and evaluates the cybersecurity risks associated with the Software Update System (SUS) responsible for securely managing over-the-air (OTA) updates to vehicle ECUs. The assessment identifies four key risks: (1) Malicious Software Installation Risk - rated as critical risk due to the potential for compromising safety-critical vehicle systems through unauthorized code; (2) Update Prevention Risk - rated as high risk as preventing legitimate updates leaves vehicles vulnerable to known exploits; (3) Unauthorized Software Rollback Risk - rated as medium risk involving exploitation of version management to install vulnerable software versions; and (4) Update Infrastructure Compromise Risk - rated as high risk due to potential fleet-wide implications of compromised update servers. For each risk, specific security controls are recommended, including enhanced cryptographic verification, secure boot implementation, resilient communication channels, multiple update delivery paths, secure version control, and infrastructure security measures. Ten detailed security requirements are defined to address these risks, all planned for implementation and verification through various testing methods. The document establishes relationships with previous TARA phases (Impact Analysis and Threat Scenarios) and maps the security requirements to system-level requirements for the Software Update System. This comprehensive assessment provides the foundation for implementing appropriate security controls to protect the vehicle fleet from software update-related cybersecurity risks."

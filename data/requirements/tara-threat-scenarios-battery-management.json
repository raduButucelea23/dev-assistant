  "contentSummary": "This TARA Threat Scenarios document identifies and analyzes five key threat scenarios affecting the Battery Management Display function in electric vehicles: (1) Battery Status Data Manipulation - involving falsification of critical battery parameters shown to drivers; (2) Charging Status Spoofing - where charging state information is falsified; (3) Battery Management Display Denial of Service - preventing drivers from viewing critical battery information; (4) Battery Health Data Falsification - manipulating long-term health indicators to trigger incorrect maintenance decisions; and (5) Battery Usage History Extraction - exposing potentially sensitive user behavior patterns from historical data. Each threat scenario is analyzed in depth, including attack vectors, attack steps, and STPA-based analysis of control flaws, unsafe control actions, and resulting loss scenarios. The feasibility assessment rates the scenarios from Low to High feasibility, with denial of service attacks being most feasible and battery health data manipulation being most complex. The document identifies specific vulnerabilities and existing controls for each threat scenario, providing a comprehensive foundation for subsequent risk assessment and security control definition."

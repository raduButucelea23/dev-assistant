For each scenario, impacts are assessed across safety, financial, operational, privacy, and reputational dimensions. Overall impact ratings are MEDIUM for volume manipulation, HIGH for file system exploitation, and LOW for denial of service. These impact ratings inform subsequent risk assessment and cybersecurity control requirements."

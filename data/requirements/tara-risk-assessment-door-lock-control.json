  "contentSummary": "Risk assessment for Door Lock Control Interface analyzing three key risks: unauthorized door unlock (RA-DOOR-01, High risk), replay attack on door commands (RA-DOOR-02, Medium risk), and denial of service (RA-DOOR-03, Medium risk). Assessment combines impact ratings from impact analysis and attack feasibility from threat scenarios. Risk treatment involves 8 security controls including message authentication, command timestamping, contextual validation, secure gateway implementation, session-based authentication, anomaly detection, rate limiting, and enhanced bus-off recovery. Implementation of these controls is estimated to reduce all risks to acceptable levels (Medium or Low), addressing key security requirements for door lock functionality."

  "contentSummary": "This TARA Risk Assessment document analyzes the cybersecurity risks associated with the Battery Management Display function in electric vehicles based on previously identified threat scenarios. The assessment identifies five key risks: (1) Battery Status Data Manipulation Risk - rated high due to safety implications of drivers making decisions based on falsified information; (2) Charging Status Spoofing Risk - rated medium due to potential for incomplete charging or infrastructure misuse; (3) Battery Management Display Denial of Service Risk - rated high due to the combination of significant impact and high feasibility; (4) Battery Health Data Falsification Risk - rated medium with financial implications for unnecessary battery replacement; and (5) Battery Usage History Privacy Risk - rated high due to potential exposure of sensitive personal information. For each risk, the document specifies a risk treatment strategy with recommended security controls, ranging from technical measures like cryptographic authentication and data encryption to procedural controls like service verification protocols. The document also defines thirteen specific security requirements that address the identified risks, all currently planned for implementation and verification through various testing methods. The comprehensive approach ensures that both safety-critical functionality and user privacy concerns are addressed through appropriate cybersecurity measures."

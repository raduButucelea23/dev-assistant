  "contentSummary": "Impact analysis for the Navigation System identifying three key damage scenarios: Navigation Misdirection (Severe impact), Position Falsification (Moderate impact), and Navigation History Exposure (Severe impact). Each scenario is assessed across safety, financial, operational, privacy, regulatory, and reputational dimensions. The document establishes ASIL ratings and FMEA data for each scenario, and defines cybersecurity goals to address each damage scenario. The Navigation System is assessed as a high-value asset due to its data sensitivity and external exposure. This analysis serves as the foundation for threat scenario development and subsequent risk assessment in the TARA process."

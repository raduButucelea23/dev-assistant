  "contentSummary": "This TARA Risk Assessment document analyzes three key security risks for the Voice Recognition System: Voice Command Spoofing Risk (medium), Voice Authentication Bypass Risk (high), and Voice Data Privacy Risk (high). Each risk is evaluated based on its impact and attack feasibility to determine an overall risk rating. The document outlines specific risk treatment strategies and recommends security controls to mitigate each risk, including enhanced voice liveness detection, multi-factor authentication, anti-replay protection, voice data encryption, and access controls. Additionally, ten detailed security requirements are defined to address the identified risks, with verification methods and implementation status specified for each requirement. The assessment draws from previous impact analysis and threat scenario documents to provide a comprehensive security evaluation of the Voice Recognition System, with particular emphasis on protecting against authentication bypass and privacy violations due to their high risk ratings."

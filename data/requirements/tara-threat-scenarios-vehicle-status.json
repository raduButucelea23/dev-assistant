  "contentSummary": "This TARA Threat Scenarios document analyzes four key threat scenarios targeting the Vehicle Status Display function in the Instrument Cluster system. The identified threats are: (1) CAN Bus Spoofing of Vehicle Status Data - falsification of displayed information through injection of spoofed messages; (2) ECU Compromise with Warning Suppression - modification of ECU firmware to prevent critical warnings from being displayed; (3) False Warning Message Injection - generating numerous fake warnings causing driver confusion and warning fatigue; and (4) Display System Denial of Service - preventing the display from functioning through message flooding or component exploitation. Each threat scenario is analyzed in detail, including attack vectors, complexity, prerequisites, and specific attack steps. The STPA analysis identifies control flaws that could enable each attack, such as lack of message authentication, insufficient plausibility checks, and vulnerable error handling. Attack feasibility ratings using CVSS indicate medium feasibility for most scenarios, with ECU firmware compromise rated as more difficult. The document identifies relevant vulnerabilities in current implementations and notes existing security controls. This analysis provides a crucial foundation for risk assessment and security control development to protect the Vehicle Status Display from potential attacks."

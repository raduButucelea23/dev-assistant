  "contentSummary": "This TARA Threat Scenarios document analyzes potential cybersecurity threats to the Software Update System (SUS) responsible for securely managing over-the-air (OTA) updates to vehicle ECUs. The analysis identifies four key threat scenarios: (1) Malicious Software Installation - an attacker bypasses authentication mechanisms to install unauthorized code with medium-high attack feasibility; (2) Software Update Prevention - an attacker disrupts the update process to prevent installation of security patches with medium attack feasibility; (3) Unauthorized Software Rollback - an attacker forces installation of vulnerable older software versions by exploiting version management weaknesses with medium-low attack feasibility; and (4) Update Server Compromise - an attacker gains control of the update infrastructure with potential fleet-wide impact with high attack feasibility but requiring advanced capabilities. Each scenario is analyzed in detail including attack vectors, step-by-step attack paths, STPA control flaws, and existing security controls. The document identifies vulnerabilities in update verification, communication channels, version management, and server infrastructure that could be exploited. Existing controls such as package signing, source authentication, retry mechanisms, and hardware security modules provide some protection but have identified weaknesses. The analysis establishes traceability to related damage scenarios from the Impact Analysis phase and to system requirements, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the security risks associated with the Software Update System."
